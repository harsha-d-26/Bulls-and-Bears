Bulls and Bears is a Mini Mathematical Game developed in C which is inspired by the traditional pen and paper game called Bulls and Cows.
In, this project, we have implemented data structures like arrays, doubly linked lists and file structures.

In the forthcoming future, we would like to implement an easy to use interface to make the exoperience much better.
